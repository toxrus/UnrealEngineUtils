Asset / Actor Action Utilities
Inspired by the work of Simon Blakeney at https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/1x0V/unreal-engine-automate-with-33-scripted-action-utilities.
Make sure to use the unreal engine version specified to load the uasset files to prevent issues. Then migrate into target project. For manual setup check the blueprintue.com links.
Also note the issues / problems listed with each Utility before using!
Please turn on the Geometry Script (experimental) and Dataprep Editor plugins to ensure that the action utils work correctly.

How to install:
Place inside content folder. That's it. Should load automatically and be useable.
